This assignment involves converting rational functions to 
power series and partial fractions.

The two most important formulas for converting rational functions to 
power series are
\[
\frac{1}{1-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
\]
and
\[
\left(
\frac{1}{1-x}
\right)^k
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{k+n-1}{n} x^n
\]
(Well ... actually the second formula include the first ... $k=1$ in
the second gives you the first.)
In order to use both, remember that $x$ is a variable.
For instance you can think of the first formula as:
\[
\frac{1}{1- \operatorname{BLAH}} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \operatorname{BLAH}^n
\]
So for instance this is also true
\[
\frac{1}{1- 12345x} 
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty (12345x)^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty 12345^n x^n
\]
Remember that if you want to test the equality above
with a specific value for $x$, you can only use a 
value for $x$ such that $|12345x| < 1$, i.e., $|x| < 1/12345$.
If you go outside this range, the power series will very likely blow up 
in your face.
Also,
\[
\left(
\frac{1}{1-123x^{567}}
\right)^{999}
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{999+n-1}{n} (123x^{567})^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \binom{999+n-1}{n} 123^n x^{567n}
\]

Note however that the two 1's must be 1's:
\[
\frac{\underline{1}}{\underline{1}-x} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n
\]
As shown in class if they are not 1's, then you just ... well ... make them 1:
\[
\frac{111}{222-333x} 
= 111 \frac{1}{222-333x} 
= \frac{111}{222} \frac{1}{1 -333x/222} 
\]

In questions where you are asked to read a coefficient, if the value is too
big, you can simply tidy up the expression and leave it as it is, i.e.,
you need not evaluate the expression to get a value. 
You can leave huge powers, binomial coefficients, etc.~alone.
