(a)
Let $T$ be the task of arranging the 6 people in a row so that the 
bride is next to the groom.
Performing $T$ is the same as performing the following in sequence.
Suppose the bride is $B$ and the groom is $G$ and the rest are
$X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4$.
Create a new symbol $BG$.
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0in]
\item[1.] Task $T_1$: Permute the symbols $X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, BG$
(There are 5! ways of doing this).
\item[2.] Task $T_2$: From the permutation from $T_1$,
replace $BG$ with $B,G$ and $G,B$ to create two permutations. 
\end{enumerate}
By the multiplication principle, there are
\[
5! 2 = 240
\]
possible permutations created.

ANSWER: \boxed{240}

(b) 
There are altogether $6!$ permutations without any restriction.
From (a), there are $5!2$ permutations where the bride and groom are next
to each other. 
Therefore there are
\[
6! - 5!2 = 480
\]
permutations where the bride and groom are not next to each other.

ANSWER: \boxed{480}

(c)
Let $X$ be the set of all permutations.
Note that $|X| = 6!$.
Let $A$ be the set of permutations where the bride is to the left of the 
groom.
Let $B$ be the set of permutations where the bride is to the right of the 
groom.
By the addition principle:
\[
|X| = |A| + |B|
\]
Now we note that there is an obvious function from $A$ to $B$:
If you are given a permutation in $A$, by swapping the bride and groom,
you have a permutation in $B$.
It is easy to see that the function has an inverse function, i.e., itself.
and hence it is 1--1 and onto.
Therefore $|A| = |B|$.
Hence from $|X| = |A| + |B|$ we have
\[
|X| = |A| + |B| = 2|A|
\]
Therefore
\[
|A| = |X|/2 = 6!/2 = 720/2 = 360
\]
Therefore there are 360 permutations where the bride is to the left of the 
groom.

ANSWER:
\boxed{360}
